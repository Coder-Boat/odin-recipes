    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These are perhaps the prettiest <em>30-minute</em> spring rolls on the block because the exterior isn’t traditional rice paper – it’s collard greens! I know. So cool. Before you get intimidated and run the other direction, screaming, “What’s a collard green and what do I do with it?” – don’t. Collard greens make such a nice swap for traditional rice paper because they’re sturdy, bendable, and insanely healthy (plenty of vitamins A, K, + C).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 bundle collard greens</li>
            <li>1 small red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups bean sprouts</li>
            <li>1 cup packed basil</li>
            <li>1 cup finely sliced red (purple) cabbage</li>
            <li>3 medium whole carrots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by wrapping your tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and setting something heavy on top (such as a cast-iron skillet) to drain the excess liquid.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prep the collard greens by chopping the stems off and using a small, sharp knife to slightly shave/trim down the thickness of the stems at the base of the leaf. This isn’t a necessary step, but it will allow it to fold/roll more easily.</li>
            <li>Next, prep vegetables and slice the tofu in long, rectangular cubes. Arrange on a tray or cutting board.</li>
            <li>Next, lay a collard green down on a flat surface, and near the stem, layer on basil, tofu, red pepper, cabbage, bean sprout, and carrot (see photo). Use your hands to fold the collard green over once so the fillings are secured inside, and then tuck in the sides of the collard green and continue rolling until you have a loose spring roll. Lay seam-side down on a serving platter and continue until all fillings are used – about 11-12 rolls.</li>
            <li>To serve, I sliced my rolls in half and arranged them in a serving bowl with a dipping sauce. But you can also just leave them whole!</li>
        </ol>
