        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Friends! I’m so excited to share my new favorite cookie with you just in time for the holidays. They’re so easy to make, ready in 20 minutes, require <em>no</em> baking and just <strong>6 ingredients</strong>, and they’re <strong>naturally</strong> sweetened! Let’s <em>(not)</em> bake!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup natural creamy salted peanut butter</li>
                    <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1 ⅓ cup almond flour</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Jam</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup dried unsweetened fruit</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp warm water</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add peanut butter to a medium mixing bowl. The peanut butter should be runny when measured. I recommend using natural peanut butter, meaning the ingredients should just be peanuts and salt. Then add maple syrup and stir until well combined. </li>
                    <li>Measure out almond flour and add a little at a time until a workable dough forms (see photo). If too dry/crumbly, add more peanut butter or maple syrup. If too sticky or wet, add a little more almond flour. We added an additional few tablespoons to achieve the right consistency.</li>
                    <li>Scoop dough out in 1 ½ Tbsp amounts and gently roll into balls. Then pick up one cookie at a time and cradle it in your palm. Use your pointer finger or thumb to make an indent, being careful not to press too forcefully to prevent cracking. If the dough cracks, smooth the cracks over before chilling. Continue until all cookies are pressed, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.</li>
                    <li>To make your jam, add dried fruit to a food processor and blend until a ball forms or only small bits remain. Then add warm water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms, scraping down sides as needed. Be careful not to add too much water or the jam will become too wet. We found 2 Tbsp (30 ml) to be the right consistency (as the recipe is written). You’re looking for a paste consistency.</li>
                    <li>Remove cookies from refrigerator and add 1/2 tsp of jam to the center of each cookie. Press down to situate the jam as needed. Repeat until all cookies are filled. You’ll have leftover jam which you can cover, refrigerate, and reserve for future cookies, PB&J sandwiches, or oats!</li>
                </ol>
