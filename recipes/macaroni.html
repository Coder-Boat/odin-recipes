    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This truly is the <strong>BEST</strong> Vegan Mac and Cheese and it’s easy to make! The stovetop version is ready in less than 20 minutes, or bake it for a few minutes with a buttery breadcrumb topping. Irresistibly cheesy and creamy <em>without</em> a hint of dairy! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups pasta shells</li>
            <li>3/4 cup vegan cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened oat milk</li>
            <li>1 large pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon nutritional yeast</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium saucepan a little more than halfway full with water, add a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions until just al dente (ours took 9 minutes). Be careful not to overcook because the shells will cook a bit longer with the cheese sauce after draining.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta (we avoided using a colander by using our saucepan lid, which has a draining feature — if yours doesn’t, drain in a colander as needed, then add back to saucepan).</li>
            <li>Immediately add the vegan cheddar cheese, almond milk (starting with lesser amount), salt, and nutritional yeast. Stir and cook over low heat, stirring frequently until the sauce melts, becomes gooey, and coats the shells. If the cheddar isn’t melting, cover to encourage it along.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately. Option to garnish with vegan parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days (not freezer friendly). Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot, adding more dairy-free milk as needed to thin.</li>
        </ol>
